# Spam Mail Prediction

## Project Overview
Spam Mail Prediction is a machine learning-based web application that classifies email content as either *Spam* or *Not Spam*. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to analyze email text and predict its category. The application is built using Python, Flask, and scikit-learn, providing a user-friendly interface for inputting email content and viewing predictions.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to **identify spam emails** using historical data and a trained machine learning model. Spam emails often follow recognizable patterns like promotional language, urgency, suspicious links, and prize announcements. By training a model to recognize these patterns, this system can help users determine if an email is safe to read or should be marked as spam.

## Problem Statement

Spam mails not only clutter our inboxes but may also contain malicious links, phishing attempts, or fraud schemes. Traditional rule-based systems are limited and canâ€™t adapt quickly. This project aims to:

- Automatically classify emails based on their content
- Build a lightweight yet effective web application
- Utilize natural language techniques for robust feature extraction
- Provide real-time results to users through an interactive UI

## Key Features

- Classifies email content as **Spam** or **Not Spam**
- Handles text cleaning using NLP techniques like:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming
- Trained on thousands of labeled emails for high accuracy
- User interface developed with Flask + HTML/CSS
- Gives prediction with confidence and safety suggestions
- Visual examples of inputs and results

## Screenshots
### Output Example 1: Not a Spam Mail

An informative or professional message that is identified as safe.

### Output Example 2: It's a Spam Mail

A message with suspicious language patterns, fake prizes, urgency â€” flagged as spam.

### ðŸ§  Model Details

- Model Used: **Logistic Regression**
- Accuracy: ~97% (can vary based on preprocessing and split)
- Fast and lightweight â€” perfect for real-time inference


## Application Workflow

1. User enters email content into the form.
2. Text is preprocessed and vectorized.
3. Preprocessed vector is passed to the ML model.
4. Prediction is returned: **Spam** or **Not Spam**.
5. UI shows result with color-coded message and safety tips.

## Installation and Run Instructions 

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local system:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spam-Mail-Prediction.git
   cd Spam-Mail-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   It's best to use a virtual environment.
   
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the Flask App**  
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Visit in Browser**
     
   ```sh
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

---
You should see the UI to enter email content and test the prediction.

## Future Enhancements
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Deploy on Heroku or AWS EC2
2. Add email address-based spam features (e.g., blacklist check)
3. Use TF-IDF or word embeddings for better vectorization
4. Implement LSTM or BERT-based models for more contextual accuracy
5.  Add an email parser to accept .eml files
6. Mobile-friendly responsive UI
